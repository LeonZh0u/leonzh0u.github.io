# TravelSpawn (also my senior project)

TravelSpawn aims to make travel planning easier. We aim to provide a middle ground between following touristy but well-traveled paths and customized but logistic-heavy plans. TravelSpawn includes three core value propositions: personalized recommendation that gives users the best travel experience; intelligent route planning that reduces the friction in exploring new places; and community of users that shares high-quality travel guides mutually. With a sizable addressable market, healthy cost structure and revenue stream, and clearly defined user segments, we aim to be the next generation go-to and all-in-one personal travel application.
